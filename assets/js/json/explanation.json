  "rotation period": "This is the length of time it takes for a body to rotate once around its axis. e.g. The rotation period of Earth is approximately 24 hours. The rotation can be measured with respect to the stars, sidereal, or the Sun, synodic.",
  "orbital period ": "This is the length of time it takes for a body to complete one full orbit around another body. e.g. The orbital period of the Moon around the Earth is approximately 27 days.",
  "distance": "This is the average distance a body is from the one it is orbiting. e.g. The average distance of the Earth from the Sun is approximately 150 million km.",
  "periapsis": "This is the closest distance an orbiting body will get to the body it is orbiting.",
  "apoapsis": "This is the furthest distance an orbiting body will get from the body it is orbiting.",
  "orbital velocity": "This is the average velocity of an orbiting body. Its velocity will be highest at perapsis and lowest at apoapsis.",
  "eccentricity": "This is a measurement of how much an orbit deviates from a circle. This value is between 0 and 1. 0 being a perfect circle. The greater the eccentricity of an orbit the greater the range between the periapsis and apoapsis.",
  "axial tilt": "This is how much a bodys axis of rotation is tilted. The Earth's axial tilt is responsible for winter and summer.",
  "number of moons": "This is the number of moons that is orbiting this body. e.g. The Earth has only 1.",
  "mass": "Mass is both a property of a body and a measurement of its resistance to acceleration. e.g. If we wish to have two bodies of mass 10kg, and 1kg, accelerate at 5m/s, the 10kg mass would require a force of 50 Newtons and the 1 kg mass would require 5 Newtons.",
  "diameter": "The diameter of a circle or sphere is a straight line that passes through the surface of it, through the center to the opposite surface.",
  "density": "This is a measurement of how much mass is contained within a unit of volume. e.g. 10kg/m^3; For each m^3 of volume, there is 10kg of mass.",
  "gravity": "This is a measurement of how much a body will accelerate towards the center of a planet/asteroid/moon etc. On the surface of the Earth a body would experience an acceleration of 9.81m/s^2 towards the center of Earth.",
  "ring system": "Some bodies will have a ring around them. Saturn isn't the only one with a ring, just the best.",
  "mean temperature": "This is the mean temperature of the bodies atmosphere.",
  "bond albedo": "This is a measurement of how much light is scattered from the surface of an object. This value ranges between 1 and 0. A value of 0 means no light is reflected, whereas 1 would mean all incident light is reflected. Venus is the brightest star in the sky with an Albedo of 0.75. So 75% of light that hits Venus will be reflected back into space.",
  "c": "Celcius. Water freezes at 0 and boils at 100.",
  "deg": "This is a measurement of an angle. A full rotation is 360 degrees.",
  "km/s": "kilometers per second. e.g. 10 k/s; for every second the body will cover a distance of 10 kilometers.",
  "AU": "Astronomical Unit. This is typically used for measuring large distances within the solar system instead of millions of km. 1 AU is equal to the Earth's average distance from the Sun.",
  "km": "The kilometer is the standard unit of distance that most physicists will use. Some people don't use standard units to the annoyance of their peers.",
  "hours": "One hour is equal to 60 minutes or 3600 seconds.",
  "days": "One day is equal to 24 hours/ 1440 minutes/ 86000 seconds.",
  "10^3km": "This is scientific notation that makes it easier to write down large or small numbers. 10^3km is 1,000km",
  "no unit": "This value is unitless",
  "10^21kg": "This is scientific notation that makes it easier to write out large/small numbers. e.g. 1.23 10^6kg would be 1,230,000kg.",
  "Earth": "Some values are measured with respect to the Earth. e.g. a diameter or mass defined as 0.6 Earth, would mean it is 0.6 times the diameter or mass of Earth.",
  "kg/m^3": "This is a measurement of density. e.g. 50 kg/m^3; There is 50 kg of mass contained within each m^3 volume.",
  "m/s^2": "This is a measurement of acceleration. e.g. 5m/s^2; For every second the velocity will increase by 5m/s.",
  "10^22kg": "This is scientific notation that makes it easier to write out large/small numbers. e.g. 1.23 10^6kg would be 1,230,000kg.",
