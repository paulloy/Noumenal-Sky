        "about": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.",
        "name": "The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios and Sol while in science fiction 'Sol' may be used as a name for the Sun to distinguish it from others."
