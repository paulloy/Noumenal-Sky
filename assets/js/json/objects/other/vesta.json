        "about": "Vesta is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt. Vesta is the second-most-massive and probably the second-largest asteroid, after the dwarf planet Ceres, and contributes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Vesta is the only known remaining rocky protoplanet of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets.",
        "discovery": "It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 29 March 1807.",
        "name": "Upon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet. The name Vesta, or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: Greece and China. In Greek, the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, Hestia. In Chinese, Vesta is called the 'hearth-god(dess) star', 灶神星 zàoshénxīng."
