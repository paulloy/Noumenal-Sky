        "about": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only larger than Mercury. Mars has been explored by unmanned spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, was the first spacecraft to visit Mars. There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. Astrobiology missions are planned, including the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers.",
