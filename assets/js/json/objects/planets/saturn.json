        "about": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.",
        "name": "Saturn is named after the Roman god of harvest and time, the equivalent of the Greek god of time, Cronos."
