        "about": "Data gathered by Cassini indicates that Dione has an internal liquid salt water ocean. Dione was first imaged by the Voyager space probes. It has also been probed five times from close distances by the Cassini orbiter.",
        "discovery": "Dione was discovered by Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684. Cassini found using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the Paris Observatory.",
        "name": "Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered 'Sidera Lodoicea' (the stars of Louis) to honor king Louis XIV. The satellites of Saturn were not named until 1847, when William Herschel's son John Herschel published Results of Astronomical Observations, suggesting that the names of the Titans be used."
