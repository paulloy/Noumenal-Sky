        "about": "The low density of Iapetus indicates that it is mostly composed of ice.  Discoveries by the Cassini mission in 2007 revealed several unusual features, such as a massive equatorial ridge running three-quarters of the way around the moon.",
        "discovery": "Iapetus was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, an Italian-born French astronomer, in October 1671.",
        "name": "Iapetus is named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology. The name was suggested by John Herschel."
