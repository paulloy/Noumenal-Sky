        "about": "Miranda is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five round satellites. The only close-up images of Miranda are from the Voyager 2 probe, which made observations of Miranda during its Uranus flyby in January 1986.",
        "discovery": "Miranda was discovered on 16 February 1948 by planetary astronomer Gerard Kuiper using the McDonald Observatory's 82-inch Otto Struve Telescope.",
        "name": "Kuiper elected to name the object 'Miranda' after the character in Shakespeare's The Tempest, because the four previously discovered moons of Uranus, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon, had all been named after characters of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. "
