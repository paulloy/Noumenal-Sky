      "about": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf."
